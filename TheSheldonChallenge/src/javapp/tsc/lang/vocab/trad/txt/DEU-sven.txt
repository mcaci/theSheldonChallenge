Something I would like to say in advance.
Germans use something called "Umlaute".
These are special letters in the alphabet (ä,ö,ü). It should not cause trouble, but some machines have difficulties displaying them.
I will write them as "Umlaute". However if you run into problems 
(and won't be able to fix them in reasonable time) 
the following substitutions apply
ä = ae
ö = oe
ü = ue
